-- 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Amazon (Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

-- Given a table 'sf_transactions' of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and calculated as ((this month’s revenue — last month’s revenue) / last month’s revenue)*100.

-- Explanation :
-- firstly calculate monthly revenue using cte and format data in yyyy-mm format using format function 
-- then using another cte map yyyy-mm with current month revenue and also previous months revenue using lag function 
-- now finally 
    -- as there is no previous month for first month of year if we are specifically finding for a specific year
    -- so we handle that case using  previous_monoth is null then null 
    -- else we calculate percent change using the provided formula and using round function we can specify upto what
    -- decimal point we need to round it 
    -- we order it by yearMonth as it is asked to find in sorted order of months
