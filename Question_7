-- -- 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: IBM(Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

-- IBM is working on a new feature to analyze user purchasing behavior for all Fridays in the first quarter of the year. For each Friday separately, calculate the average amount users have spent per order. The output should contain the week number of that Friday and average amount spent.

-- 🔍 By solving this, you'll learn how to handle date and time by the end of the day. Give it a try! 👇

-- 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭:
-- CREATE TABLE user_purchases(user_id int, date date, amount_spent float, day_name varchar(15));

-- INSERT INTO user_purchases VALUES(1047,'2023-01-01',288,'Sunday'),(1099,'2023-01-04',803,'Wednesday'),(1055,'2023-01-07',546,'Saturday'),(1040,'2023-01-10',680,'Tuesday'),(1052,'2023-01-13',889,'Friday'),(1052,'2023-01-13',596,'Friday'),(1016,'2023-01-16',960,'Monday'),(1023,'2023-01-17',861,'Tuesday'),(1010,'2023-01-19',758,'Thursday'),(1013,'2023-01-19',346,'Thursday'),(1069,'2023-01-21',541,'Saturday'),(1030,'2023-01-22',175,'Sunday'),(1034,'2023-01-23',707,'Monday'),(1019,'2023-01-25',253,'Wednesday'),(1052,'2023-01-25',868,'Wednesday'),(1095,'2023-01-27',424,'Friday'),(1017,'2023-01-28',755,'Saturday'),(1010,'2023-01-29',615,'Sunday'),(1063,'2023-01-31',534,'Tuesday'),(1019,'2023-02-03',185,'Friday'),(1019,'2023-02-03',995,'Friday'),(1092,'2023-02-06',796,'Monday'),(1058,'2023-02-09',384,'Thursday'),(1055,'2023-02-12',319,'Sunday'),(1090,'2023-02-15',168,'Wednesday'),(1090,'2023-02-18',146,'Saturday'),(1062,'2023-02-21',193,'Tuesday'),(1023,'2023-02-24',259,'Friday');

-- solution :
with Q1_fridays as (select 
    user_id,
    date,
    amount_spent,
    DATEPART(week,date) as week_number ,
    day_name 
from 
    user_purchases 
where 
    day_name="Friday" and DATEPART(month,date) in (1,2,3)
    
) 
select 
    user_id,
    round(avg(amount_spent),2) as average_amount_spent_on_each_order 
from Q1_fridays
group by 
    week_number 
order by 
    week_number 

-- firstly using datepart find all the fridays and in where clause also using datepart sort month which are in quarter 1 
-- then calculate avg of amount spent and group by week_number and as group by does not specify order of rows so we need to order by week number as well
